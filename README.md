# DataScienceProject-ChurnPrediction-WazeUsers-EDA-Regression-DecisionTree

**Project Overview:**
This project analyzes a dataset to identify customers at risk of churn. The work includes performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, building predictive models, and deriving actionable insights. The predictive models used are a **binomial logistic regression** model and a **decision tree**. The project demonstrates expertise in data preparation, model evaluation, and interpretation.

**Purpose and Objective**

The primary aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in EDA and predictive modeling while achieving the following objectives:

*1. **Predicting Customer Churn:** Identify customers likely to churn, helping businesses focus retention efforts.
*2. **Improving Retention Strategies:** Provide actionable insights to proactively address churn and enhance customer loyalty.
*3. **Enhancing Decision-Making:** Use data-driven insights to support strategic planning and improve overall business decision-making processes.

**Business Relevance:**

Predicting churn is a critical business objective, but it is equally important to provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn. This project ensures alignment with business needs by:

* Highlighting key drivers of churn.
* Offering strategies to improve customer retention.

**Structure of the Notebook**
The notebook is organized into three key parts:

**Part 1: EDA & Model Assumption Checking**

  * Purpose: Understand why EDA is important before constructing a binomial logistic regression model.
  * Includes analysis to verify assumptions like data distributions and multicollinearity.

**Part 2: Model Building and Evaluation**

**Resources Used:**
  * Python libraries: This project utilizes Python libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation, and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models are implemented using `scikit-learn`, with tools like `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
  * Model types: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
  * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
    
**Part 3: Interpreting Model Results**

* EDA identified trends, correlations, and inconsistencies, aiding in feature selection and preparation.
* Logistic Regression revealed linear relationships between predictors and churn probability.
* The Decision Tree captured non-linear interactions and offered broader insights into feature importance.
* `Activity_days` emerged as the most influential predictor of churn.
* Actionable recommendations were derived to enhance customer retention strategies.
